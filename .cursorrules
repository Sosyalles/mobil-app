# UI/UX Development Guidelines for Mobile App

## 1. Modular Structure  
- UI components should be designed as reusable and modular elements.  
- Use a **component-based** architecture for scalability and consistency.  
- Keep styling and functionality separate for maintainability.  

## 2. Layout & Design  
- Follow a **clean, minimal, and modern design** approach.  
- Use a **mobile-first** design principle.  
- Ensure a **consistent margin, padding, and spacing system** across all screens.  
- Implement a **fluid grid system** for flexible layouts.  

## 3. Typography & Colors  
- Use a **fun and inviting font** (e.g., Poppins, Baloo, Quicksand).  
- Maintain **aesthetic contrast** between text and background.  
- **Primary Colors:** Warm Orange (#FF7F50), Soft Gray (#6D6D6D), Cream (#FFF5E1).  

## 4. Components & UI Elements  
- **Navbar:** Contains logo, notifications, and search bar.  
- **Hero Section:** Eye-catching image with a short tagline.  
- **Categories Section:** Grid or horizontal scrollable buttons.  
- **Event Cards:** Display event details (name, date, participation).  
- **Footer Navigation:** Home, Explore, Messages, Profile.  

## 5. User Interaction  
- Use **smooth animations** and **transitions** for a fluid experience.  
- Provide **haptic feedback** for interactive elements.  
- Buttons should have **press states, hover states, and disabled states**.  

## 6. Performance & Optimization  
- Optimize **image sizes and assets** for better performance.  
- Use **lazy loading** for non-essential UI elements.  
- Keep UI responsive for **different screen sizes** and **devices**.  

## 7. Accessibility & UX  
- Ensure **readability** with proper text sizes and contrast.  
- Implement **accessible color schemes** for visually impaired users.  
- Buttons and touch areas should be **large enough** for easy interaction.  

## 8. Navigation & Flow  
- Keep navigation **intuitive and easy to use**.  
- Use a **bottom navigation bar** for quick access to main sections.  
- Ensure seamless **screen transitions** without breaking the user journey.
